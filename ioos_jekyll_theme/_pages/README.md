This page is a placeholder Jekyll markdown example page.

Adapt this site to your layout needs by modifying a few files and uploading content in the form of
additional Markdown files to GitHub.  

### Documentation ###
This template, adapted for IOOS look and feel, is based on the 'Minimal Mistakes' Jekyll theme, published here:
[https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes).  

Documentation for working with the Minimal Mistakes template is can be found here:
[https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

Begin by modifying [\_config.yml](https://github.com/ioos/ioos_jekyll_theme/blob/master/_config.yml) with appropriate
settings for your repository, and modifying the site navigation in the [navigation.yml](https://github.com/ioos/ioos_jekyll_theme/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml)
configuration file.

If you are able to run the Jekyll environment locally, refer to [this](https://ioos.github.io/ioos_jekyll_theme/pages/jekyll/) page for information on setting it up to support local development.

### GitHub Pages and Jekyll ###
Information on the way GitHub uses Jekyll in 'GitHub Pages' sites can be found here:
[https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/](https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-pages-and-jekyll/)

In particular, to push documentation for a 'Project' page (which most repos will fall under), use a
specially-named branch 'gh-pages' to push content to.  More information on this requirement can be
found here: [https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/](https://help.github.com/articles/user-organization-and-project-pages/)
